# Project work
 Numerical Methods in Scientific Computing -course project work involving stopping power.

 The task was to do calculation of nuclear stopping power of an ion and compare it with a universal nuclear stopping power formula that is based on fitting a suitable formula to a large number of individually calculated projectile-target combinations. 

 Numerical calculations were based on the general stopping power formula which included classical scattering integral of the ion and the atom interacting via a screened Coulomb potential. Using the integral, distance of minimum approach of the ion and the atom was found and it depended on a collision parameter _b_.
