# Project work
 Numerical Methods in Scientific Computing -course project work involving stopping power.

 The task was to do calculation of nuclear stopping power of an ion and compare it with a universal nuclear stopping power formula that is based on fitting a suitable formula to a large number of individually calculated projectile-target combinations.
